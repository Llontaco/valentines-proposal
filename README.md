# Valentine's Day Proposal App 💝

A cute and interactive Valentine's Day proposal application built with Python and Tkinter. The app features a playful interface where the "YES" button grows larger each time "NO" is clicked, making it increasingly difficult to resist the romantic proposal.


## Prerequisites 📋

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)
- The [`sunflower.py`](https://github.com/Sandreke/turtle-python/blob/main/04.py) script or any other in the same directory (for the surprise animation)

## Installation 🚀

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sandreke/valentines-proposal.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd valentines-proposal
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python valentine_proposal.py
```

## How It Works 🔧

The application presents a simple choice between "YES" and "NO". Each time the user clicks "NO", the "YES" button grows larger, making it more tempting to accept the proposal. When "YES" is finally clicked, a sweet message appears followed by a surprise [sunflower](https://github.com/Sandreke/turtle-python/blob/main/04.py) animation (or any Python script you want).
